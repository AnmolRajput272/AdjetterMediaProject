1) Hour of the day when the call volume is highest.
2) Hour of the day when the calls are longest.
3) Day of the week when the call volume is highest.
4) Day of the week when the calls are longest.

I Have Also Included, All The Minimum Queries Too, For Improving The Project And Analysis :

So The Extra Things, That You Also Find, Are :

5) Hour of the day when the call volume is Lowest.
6) Hour of the day when the calls are Lowest.
7) Day of the week when the call volume is Lowest.
8) Day of the week when the calls are Lowest.


Along With All The Details , I Have Also Made A DataSet To JSON Converter, Specially For Our Project, So That, If The Dataset is big, We Wont Face Issues In Giving The Input To The Program.


Coming On The Performance, The Program Runs In Linear Time, ie, We Will Not Face Any Issue, Till The Input size is 10^6.
